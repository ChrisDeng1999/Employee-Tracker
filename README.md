## Description

This is my Employee Tracker app. This is a command line app that allows the user to store information regarding their employees, managers, as well as information about roles and departments. This allows the user to keep their team members organized and allows the user to keep track of all the different types of roles, departments, and salary.


## Installation

Once you have installed the application, you will have to type node index.js in your terminal and you should be able to begin using the app. There are a lot of different things you can do with this so have fun and explore!

Below is a link to a quick video that goes over what the application can do!
